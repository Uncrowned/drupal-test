Iâ€™m a Linux\Unix guru OR Mac user.

Install Virtual box 4.2.x (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
Install Vagrant 1.3.4 (http://downloads.vagrantup.com)
Install Vagrant Hosts Updater plugin with command
> vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater
Install Putty (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)
Install NFS server
Pull git repository from to project dir  (if need)
Open console and change directory to project dir. If you use windows, blame Bill Gates for poor console. Install and use PowerShell, it looks like more useful.
	Run command
	$ vagrant up
Now Vagrant is configuring your developer server (install all necessary software). You have about 1 hour to drink coffee. Check from time to time if everything is ok, and no errors. When vagrant finishes ....
Run
$ vagrant ssh
Now you are in virtual machine. Project code is mapped into directory /vagrant.
